# MKEx

MKEx is an integrated container orchestration platform that is powered by an immutable Rocky Linux operating system, offering next-level security and reliability.

This repository contains a collection of tool, utilities and guides for managing and operating with MKEx. These tools support operations, automation, and configuration for secure and scalable container environments.

## Provisioning

Provisioning is the process of preparing a cluster of MKEx compute nodes within a network environment that meets the requirements for deploying and operating Mirantis products.

For further details, please see [provisioning document](docs/provisioning.md).

### Assets

Mirantis provides assets for provisioning MKEx on different providers. Assets consist of bootable images that can be used to provision virtual machine or baremetale machine.
