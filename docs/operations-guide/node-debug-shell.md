# Open a debug shell on a node

How to get a root shell on a `bootc-mke3` node through the Kubernetes API,
without SSH. A privileged container pinned to the node gives access to the
host's filesystem, process table, and namespaces — the operations a `bootc`
node's immutable, SSH-less design otherwise makes awkward.

Two paths are documented: `kubectl debug` for one node, and a Pod manifest for
several nodes at once or for options `kubectl debug` does not expose.

## Security

A debug shell created here is **root-equivalent on the node it lands on**. The
container is privileged and mounts the host root filesystem at `/host`, so it
can read every secret on disk and enter every host namespace. Treat the ability
to create these pods as `cluster-admin` on the cluster's nodes, and delete the
pods when the investigation is over — nothing expires them.

## Requirements

1. `kubectl` configured from an MKE client bundle — see
   [Access the cluster](access-cluster.md).
2. The privilege grant and the `cluster-support` namespace from
   [Run privileged support containers on MKE](privileged-support-containers.md).
   MKE's admission controller rejects these pods without it.
3. `envsubst` (package `gettext`/`gettext-base`) on your workstation, for the
   multi-node path.
4. The cluster's MKE version, for the image tag. With the client bundle's
   `env.sh` sourced (see [Access the cluster](access-cluster.md#use-docker-swarm-socket)),
   the Swarm socket reports it:

   ```sh
   docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'    # e.g. ucp/3.9.5 → tag 3.9.5
   ```

   The MKE UI also shows it (**Admin Settings**), and on a node itself the
   `ucp-proxy` container carries it as the label
   `com.docker.ucp.version`.

   The image used below, `mirantis/ucp-dsinfo`, is MKE's own troubleshooting
   image on Docker Hub, tagged by MKE version; it already contains `bash`,
   `nsenter`, `curl`, `jq`, `tar`, and the `docker` CLI. In an air-gapped
   cluster, mirror `mirantis/ucp-dsinfo:<MKE version>` into the local registry
   first and use that reference instead.

## Procedure

### Option 1 — One node, with `kubectl debug`

`kubectl debug` builds the same kind of pod itself. The `sysadmin` profile
makes the container privileged, and the node debugger always pins the pod to
the target node, shares the host namespaces, and mounts the host root
filesystem at `/host`:

```sh
kubectl debug node/<node-name> -it -n cluster-support \
  --profile=sysadmin \
  --image=mirantis/ucp-dsinfo:3.9.5 \
  -- bash
```

- `-n cluster-support` is required, not cosmetic: the pod runs as that
  namespace's `default` ServiceAccount, which is the identity the privilege
  grant covers. Without it the pod lands in `default` and MKE denies it.
- The pod is **not** deleted when you exit. Remove it explicitly:

  ```sh
  kubectl -n cluster-support get pods            # find node-debugger-<node>-xxxxx
  kubectl -n cluster-support delete pod node-debugger-<node>-xxxxx
  ```

Upstream reference:
[debugging a node with kubectl debug](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/kubectl-node-debug/).

If your MKE version's admission controller rejects the pod `kubectl debug`
generates, use option 2 — the manifest is explicit about every attribute it
requests.

### Option 2 — One or many nodes, with a manifest

The template
[`debug-shell-pod.yaml.tmpl`](../examples/cluster-support/debug-shell-pod.yaml.tmpl)
contains a single `envsubst` variable, `${NODE_NAME}`. Edit the image tag in it
once to match your MKE version, then fan out over any node selector:

```sh
cd docs/examples/cluster-support

# One node
NODE_NAME=<node-name> envsubst < debug-shell-pod.yaml.tmpl | kubectl apply -f -

# Every manager node
for node in $(kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do
  NODE_NAME=$node envsubst < debug-shell-pod.yaml.tmpl | kubectl apply -f -
done

# Every node
for node in $(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do
  NODE_NAME=$node envsubst < debug-shell-pod.yaml.tmpl | kubectl apply -f -
done
```

Wait for them and attach to one:

```sh
kubectl -n cluster-support wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=node-debug-shell --timeout=120s
kubectl -n cluster-support get pods -l app=node-debug-shell -o wide
kubectl -n cluster-support exec -it debug-shell-<node-name> -- bash
```

Delete all of them when finished — the pods run `sleep infinity` and persist
until removed:

```sh
kubectl -n cluster-support delete pod -l app=node-debug-shell
```

## Using the shell

Inside the container, three levels of host access are available.

### Read host files directly

The node's root filesystem is mounted at `/host`:

```sh
cat /host/etc/os-release            # Rocky Linux release of the bootc image
ls /host/var/log/                   # host logs, including support bundles
cat /host/etc/docker/daemon.json
```

### Run host binaries with `chroot`

For host-native tooling that expects the host's own libraries and paths:

```sh
chroot /host bootc status
chroot /host rpm-ostree status
chroot /host systemctl list-units --failed
```

### Enter the host namespaces with `nsenter`

Fullest access: run a command as if it were started on the host itself — the
host's mount, UTS, IPC, network, and PID namespaces, and therefore its
cgroups, sockets (`docker.sock`, journald), and process tree:

```sh
nsenter --target 1 --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid -- journalctl -u kubelet --no-pager
nsenter --target 1 --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid -- docker ps -a
nsenter --target 1 --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid -- systemctl status docker
nsenter --target 1 --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid -- bash    # interactive host shell
```

`--target 1` is PID 1 on the *host* because the pod sets `hostPID: true`. This
is how the support-bundle collectors reach host tooling; see
[Collect support bundles from nodes](collect-support-bundles.md).

### Retrieve a file from the node

`kubectl cp` works against the debug pod, so a file on the node can be pulled
to your workstation without SSH:

```sh
kubectl -n cluster-support cp \
  debug-shell-<node-name>:/host/var/log/cluster-support/<bundle>.tar.gz \
  ./<bundle>.tar.gz
```

## Expected Results

- `kubectl -n cluster-support get pods -l app=node-debug-shell -o wide` shows
  one `Running` pod per targeted node, each on its own node.
- `kubectl -n cluster-support exec -it debug-shell-<node> -- cat /host/etc/os-release`
  prints the node's Rocky Linux release — proof the mount is the real host
  filesystem, not the container image's.
- `nsenter --target 1 --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid -- docker ps` lists the
  node's MKE containers.

## F.A.Q

### Why not just SSH to the node?

`bootc-mke3` clusters are built to run with SSH disabled after install (see
[no-touch join](no-touch-join.md)). This path uses only the MKE endpoint, is
authorized by MKE RBAC, and is audited by the Kubernetes API server.

### The pod stays `Pending`. Why?

A pinned pod (`spec.nodeName`) is never scheduled, so `Pending` means the
kubelet has not accepted it. Check `kubectl -n cluster-support describe pod
<name>`: the usual causes are a taint the toleration does not cover, a
misspelled node name, or the kubelet being down — in which case the node needs
console access, not a debug shell.

### The pod is rejected at creation.

Admission denied it. The message names the attributes
(`privileged hostpid hostbindmounts`) and the ServiceAccount. Re-check
[the privilege grant](privileged-support-containers.md), especially that the
pod is being created in `cluster-support`.

### Can I use a different image?

Yes — any image with a shell works, and `--image` / the manifest's `image` is
the only change needed. `mirantis/ucp-dsinfo` is documented because it is
already mirrored in MKE environments and carries the MKE troubleshooting
tooling. Nothing in this runbook depends on its entrypoint.

### Does anything clean these pods up automatically?

No. Both paths leave the pod running until it is deleted. Include the delete
command in your investigation notes; a forgotten privileged pod is a standing
root shell on a node.
