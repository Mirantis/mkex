# Verify bootc-mke3 image signatures

`bootc-mirantis` (the repository that builds and pushes `bootc-mke3` OCI
images) cosign-signs every image it pushes: the `rocky-9-base` base image
and the versioned `bootc-mke3` product image, in both its dev registry
(`registry.ci.mirantis.com/bootc-mke3-dev`) and prod registry
(`registry.mirantis.com/bootc-mke3`), each registry with its own key pair.
This runbook covers verifying that signature — a check you can run at any of
three points in an image's lifecycle in this repo:

- **Mirroring** it into your own internal/air-gapped registry — see the
  [air-gap runbook](../installation-guide/airgap-bootc-mke3.md).
- **Pulling** it for use, e.g. before referencing it in an Ansible inventory
  or kickstart file — see [Provisioning](../installation-guide/provisioning.md#registry).
- **Using** it — installing from it (Generic ISO kickstart, see
  [ISO editions](../installation-guide/iso-editions.md#generic-image-customisation))
  or switching an existing node to it during an upgrade (see
  [Upgrade via the ClusterUpgrade CR](upgrade-with-controller.md) or the
  [Ansible exception path](upgrade-with-ansible.md)).

## Prerequisites

1. `cosign` v2.5.3 installed on the machine doing the verification — this
   matches the version `bootc-mirantis` signs with. Newer major versions
   (v3.x) change flag semantics for transparency-log handling and are not
   guaranteed compatible with the signatures produced here.
2. The current public key for the registry you're verifying against (`dev`
   or `prod`). Public keys are **not** committed to any repository and are
   **not** published to any URL — ask PRODENG for the current key. See
   `bootc-mirantis`'s
   [`docs/cosign-signing.md`](https://github.com/Mirantis/bootc-mirantis/blob/main/docs/cosign-signing.md)
   for the current key-storage and retrieval policy, and for what to do if
   you suspect a key has rotated.

## Verify

```sh
# prod — registry.mirantis.com, uploads to the public Rekor transparency log
cosign verify --key <path-to-prod-public-key-from-PRODENG> \
  registry.mirantis.com/bootc-mke3/<image>:<tag>

# dev — registry.ci.mirantis.com/bootc-mke3-dev, no transparency log
cosign verify --key <path-to-dev-public-key-from-PRODENG> \
  --private-infrastructure=true registry.ci.mirantis.com/bootc-mke3-dev/<image>:<tag>
```

`<image>` is `rocky-9-base` or the versioned `bootc-mke3` product image name
(of the form `r<rocky-version>-mcr<mcr-version>-mke<mke-version>-bare`, see
the [Assets section](../../README.md#assets)); `<tag>` is whichever build
tag you're mirroring, pulling, or switching to.

A signature mismatch, a missing signature, or a key mismatch makes `cosign
verify` exit non-zero and print a diagnostic — treat that as a hard failure
and do not mirror, pull, install from, or switch to that image. Check the
exit code; a non-zero exit is the failure signal, not merely the presence of
warning text on stdout.

## At mirroring time

Before or during mirroring a `bootc-mke3` OCI image into your own registry
(see the [air-gap runbook](../installation-guide/airgap-bootc-mke3.md)),
verify it against the source registry (`registry.mirantis.com` or
`registry.ci.mirantis.com/bootc-mke3-dev`) using the command above.
Mirroring tools that copy by digest (e.g. `skopeo copy`) copy the image
manifest but do not necessarily carry the cosign signature — signatures are
stored as separate OCI artifacts alongside the image — so verify against the
source before copying, and re-verify against the destination afterwards if
your mirroring tool is not known to copy signature artifacts too.

## At pull time

Before pulling a `bootc-mke3` image reference into an Ansible variable
(`bootc_image_ref` in `vars/upgrade-vars.yml`), a kickstart file, or a
manual `podman pull`/`skopeo copy`, verify it with the command above against
whichever registry (`registry.mirantis.com`, your internal mirror, or the
dev registry) that reference resolves to.

## At install/switch time

- **Initial install (Generic ISO kickstart):** verify the `<oci-name>`
  before putting it in the kickstart's `bootc switch --mutate-in-place
  --transport registry <oci-name>` line — see
  [Generic image customisation](../installation-guide/iso-editions.md#generic-image-customisation).
- **Upgrade:** verify the target `bootc_image_ref` (Ansible path, see
  [Upgrade via Ansible](upgrade-with-ansible.md)) or `spec.os.image`
  (`ClusterUpgrade` CR path, see
  [Upgrade via the ClusterUpgrade CR](upgrade-with-controller.md#1-determine-the-target-image-references))
  before applying it — both drive `bootc switch`/`bootc upgrade` on cluster
  nodes.

## Scope

Only images `bootc-mirantis` pushes itself are covered today: `rocky-9-base`
and the versioned `bootc-mke3` product image, in both the dev and prod
registries. Controller images and Helm charts
(`cluster-upgrade-controller`, `machine-config-controller`) are **not**
signed yet — PRODENG-3686 (in progress, not yet merged) plans to add cosign
signing of those controllers' production images. Until that work lands and
is merged, do not expect `cosign verify` to succeed against controller
images or charts.

## Key rotation

Keys rotate independently per environment (dev/prod), and this repo is not
notified when that happens. Always ask PRODENG for the *current* key rather
than reusing a previously obtained one, and re-verify if you suspect a
rotation occurred since you last checked.
